<ul>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p><i>For the Filling:</i></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (15 ounces) pure pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Crust: </b>In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add chilled, cubed butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, pulsing until the dough starts to come together. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, knead gently, and shape it into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Roll Out the Crust: </b>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the rolled-out crust to a 9-inch pie dish, gently pressing it into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish.</li>
    <li><b>Prepare the Filling: </b>In a large bowl, whisk together pumpkin puree, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in evaporated milk and vanilla extract, ensuring a smooth and homogeneous mixture.</li>
    <li><b>Assemble and Bake: </b>Pour the pumpkin filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until the center is set. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. For an extra touch, top with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
