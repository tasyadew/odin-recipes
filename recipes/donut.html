<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 cup warm water (110°F/43°C)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm milk (110°F/43°C)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Dough: </b>In a bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the activated yeast mixture, salt, softened butter, and egg. Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li><b>Shape and Cut the Donuts: </b>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/2-inch thickness. Use a round cutter to cut out donuts, and then use a smaller cutter for the donut holes. Place the cut donuts on a floured baking sheet and let them rise for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><b>Fry the Donuts: </b>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large, deep skillet to 350°F (175°C). Carefully fry the donuts in batches for about 1-2 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Remove the donuts with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li><b>Prepare the Glaze: </b>In a bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Dip each cooled donut into the glaze, ensuring they are fully coated. Place the glazed donuts on a wire rack to allow any excess glaze to drip off.</li>
