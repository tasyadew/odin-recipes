<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mini marshmallows</li>
    <li>1/4 cup crushed candy canes (optional, for a festive touch)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Pan: </b>Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. This will make it easier to lift the fudge out later.</li>
    <li><b>Melt the Chocolate Mixture: </b>In a medium-sized saucepan over low heat, combine the chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter. Stir continuously until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
    <li><b>Add Cocoa Powder and Flavorings: </b>Stir in the cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture is glossy and everything is fully incorporated.</li>
    <li><b>Incorporate Marshmallows: </b>Gently fold in the mini marshmallows, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
    <li><b>Transfer to the Pan: </b>Pour the hot chocolate fudge mixture into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.</li>
    <li><b>Add Optional Toppings </b>Sprinkle crushed candy canes over the top if you desire a festive touch. Press them lightly into the fudge.</li>
    <li><b>Chill the Fudge: </b>Refrigerate the fudge for at least 2-3 hours or until it is completely set.</li>
    <li><b>Cut and Serve: </b>Once set, use the parchment paper overhang to lift the fudge out of the pan. Place it on a cutting board and cut it into bite-sized squares.</li>
