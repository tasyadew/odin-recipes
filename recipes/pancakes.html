<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
    <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Prepare the Batter: </b>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li><b>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients: </b>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold them together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine.</li>
    <li><b>Add Blueberries: </b>Gently fold in the blueberries until evenly distributed throughout the batter. This step ensures that each pancake is packed with juicy bursts of blueberry flavor.</li>
    <li><b>Preheat the Griddle or Pan: </b>Place a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat and let it preheat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to coat the surface.</li>
    <li><b>Cook the Pancakes: </b>Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the preheated griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges begin to set. Flip the pancakes and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
    <li><b>Serve Warm: </b>Once cooked, transfer the pancakes to a plate and keep them warm. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
    <li><b>Garnish and Enjoy: </b>Serve the pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup, a dollop of whipped cream, or additional fresh blueberries for a delightful finishing touch. Enjoy your fluffy blueberry pancakes while they're warm and inviting!</li>
