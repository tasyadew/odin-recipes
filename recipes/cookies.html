<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Additional granulated sugar for rolling (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Preheat the Oven: </b>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
    <li><b>Cream the Butter and Sugars: </b>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done with a hand mixer or stand mixer.</li>
    <li><b>Incorporate Peanut Butter and Eggs: </b>Add in the creamy peanut butter and mix until well combined. Then, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the pure vanilla extract.</li>
    <li><b>Combine Dry Ingredients: </b>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the peanut butter mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><b>Form Cookie Dough Balls: </b>Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of cookie dough and roll them into balls. For an extra touch, roll each ball in granulated sugar to add a sweet and crunchy coating.</li>
    <li><b>Arrange on Baking Sheets: </b>Place the cookie dough balls onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading during baking.</li>
    <li><b>Bake to Perfection: </b>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Keep in mind that the cookies will continue to firm up as they cool, so avoid overbaking.</li>
    <li><b>Cool and Enjoy: </b>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, these delightful Peanut Butter Cookies are ready to be enjoyed with a glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage.</li>
